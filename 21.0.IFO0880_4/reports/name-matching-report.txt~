     Enzyme Name to Reaction Mapping Report
     ======================================

 This report describes the results of using the gene product
 EC numbers, GO terms, and enzyme names in your input file(s) to assign
 enzymes to reaction activities.

 When a protein function name (i.e., one of the gene product name strings from your
 input file) matches an entry in the reference database (e.g., MetaCyc), there are two 
 possibilities:

 - It is an unambiguous match, for which the corresponding Enzymatic-Reaction
   connection has been created automatically (in all other cases,
   no connection is created, and the decision is left to the user).

 - It is an ambiguous match, meaning that more than one biochemical
   reaction has been identified using that enzyme name from the
   different sources that went into building our name mapping database.
   These cases should be examined by the user to resolve
   the ambiguities, and to create the Enzymatic-Reaction connections.

 When the function name does not match anything in the mapping database,
 the user should try to perform selected substring searches, to potentially
 find correspondences that the automatic string matching missed.
 The non-matches that appear to be probable enzymes are identified in this 
 report to aid the user in refining their input file for a subsequent run.

 Please see the PathoLogic documentation for more information on how to 
 refine your input file to achieve a higher number of matches.
